In both companies and educational institutions, managing attendance is an essential responsibility. Conventional techniques, such manual attendance and RFID-based systems, are labor-intensive, prone to abuse, and prone to mistakes. We suggest a Smart Attendance System that uses face recognition and computer vision technologies to automate attendance marking in order to overcome these difficulties.

To detect and identify student faces, our system is built with Python, OpenCV (cv2), and the face recognition library. The procedure is using a camera to take a picture of each student's face ID, saving it in a local dataset, and then instantly identifying it during attendance sessions. The technology automatically logs attendance in an Excel sheet as soon as a match is discovered.

We also intend to create a web-based platform for improved management and accessibility. The platform will have the following features:

Students can upload crisp photos to be included in the dataset by logging in.

Access to attendance records kept in Excel sheets is made possible via the teacher login.

Admin Control: Provides complete access for system upkeep and enhancement.


The goal of this project is to create an automated, safe, and effective attendance system that improves institutional record-keeping, lowers errors, and requires less human intervention.
